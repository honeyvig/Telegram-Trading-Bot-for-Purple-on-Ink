# Telegram-Trading-Bot-for-Purple-on-Ink
Trading bot for our crypto project

We are the top 1 token launched on Ink (Kraken's new L2). We are called Purple. You can find as on dexscreener and filtering to ink. There is already a tracking  buys bot built on Ink but a lot of times doesn't work.

We have 4 pools on 4 different DEXs the biggest on inkySwap. We are also on squidswap, velodrome and reservoir.
There is already an aggregator on ink called superswap that given our 4 pools nature is the best way to buy $PURPLE.
We have 4 becuase Ink is so new that is not clear yet who will be the leading DEX

Would you be able to build the bots for us? How much would it be? How much time would you need? We need a buy bot, a price alert bot, a big purhcases bot and a liquidity alerts bot. Do you think this is feasible to do atm on Ink given that there is no indexer yet?

This bot could be something massive given there are none at the moment on ink and the chain backed by Kraken has the potential to be the new Base.
------
Creating a trading bot ecosystem for your $PURPLE token, given the current state of the Ink ecosystem, presents an exciting opportunity, especially as Ink is new and there aren’t many bots available yet. The project is technically feasible but will require addressing several unique challenges, especially the lack of a robust indexer.

Here’s how I would break down the different bots you’re looking for and a suggested approach for developing them in React Native and other required components, like smart contracts or backend services:
1. Core Bots to Develop:

You need the following bots:

    Buy Bot: A bot that automatically purchases $PURPLE based on conditions or triggers (like a price change, amount, etc.).
    Price Alert Bot: A bot that alerts users when $PURPLE reaches a specified price.
    Big Purchases Bot: A bot that detects and alerts when a significant purchase (like whale buys) occurs.
    Liquidity Alerts Bot: A bot that alerts when liquidity changes significantly in any of the DEX pools.

2. Challenges & Feasibility:

    Lack of Indexer: Since there’s no indexer yet on Ink, we’ll need to use the data available via APIs, including the aggregators (like Superswap), the DEXs (InkySwap, Squidswap, Velodrome, Reservoir), or directly from the Ink chain. We'll need to develop our own event listener to track changes.
    API/Smart Contract Interaction: Each DEX and liquidity pool likely has its own set of APIs or smart contract calls to monitor for price, trades, and liquidity. A custom solution to interact with these is needed.

3. Tech Stack:

    React Native for building the mobile application that users interact with.
    Web3.js or Ethers.js for interacting with the blockchain and smart contracts on Ink.
    Node.js for backend services to handle bot operations (price monitoring, triggering buy alerts, etc.).
    Superswap API (or aggregators like it) for retrieving aggregated price and liquidity data.
    Push Notifications (e.g., Firebase, OneSignal) for alert bots.

4. Bot Design Overview:
A. Buy Bot:

The Buy Bot will automate trades when certain conditions are met (such as price changes or specific buy triggers).

    Requirements:
        Track the $PURPLE token’s price across the 4 DEXs.
        Monitor price differences between the DEXs to identify the most favorable purchase conditions.
        Automatically execute a purchase transaction on the DEX (via Superswap or direct pool interaction).

    Implementation:
        Use Superswap’s API to monitor aggregated prices.
        For each DEX, interact with smart contracts (via Web3.js or Ethers.js) to execute a trade when conditions are met.
        Ensure that the bot doesn’t exceed gas costs by checking transaction fees beforehand.

Example of executing a transaction (using Web3.js):

const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.ink-chain'); // Replace with Ink RPC URL

const buyToken = async (recipient, amount) => {
  const contractAddress = '0x123456...'; // Contract address of $PURPLE
  const senderPrivateKey = '0x...'; // Sender private key

  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, contractAddress);

  const data = contract.methods.buy(amount).encodeABI(); // Replace with actual method
  const tx = {
    to: contractAddress,
    data,
    gas: 200000,  // Estimate gas
    gasPrice: await web3.eth.getGasPrice(),
  };

  const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, senderPrivateKey);
  const receipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);

  console.log('Transaction successful:', receipt);
};

B. Price Alert Bot:

This bot will notify users when $PURPLE reaches a certain price.

    Requirements:
        Track real-time prices for $PURPLE.
        Notify users when the price crosses a user-defined threshold.

    Implementation:
        Poll Superswap or other APIs periodically for price data.
        Store user alert preferences (thresholds) in a database.
        Trigger notifications (via Firebase, OneSignal, etc.) when the price meets the criteria.

const checkPriceAndAlert = async () => {
  const price = await getCurrentPrice(); // Function to fetch price from Superswap API

  const userAlertThreshold = 10; // Example threshold value

  if (price >= userAlertThreshold) {
    sendPushNotification("Price Alert", `Price reached ${price}`);
  }
};

// Triggering an alert
const sendPushNotification = (title, message) => {
  // Firebase or OneSignal integration for push notifications
};

C. Big Purchases Bot:

This bot will monitor large buys or significant market movements (whale buys).

    Requirements:
        Listen for significant buy orders on the DEXs.
        Send alerts when large purchases occur.

    Implementation:
        Monitor transactions on the DEXs (via blockchain events).
        Use Event Listeners in Ethers.js to listen for Transfer events or Swap events.

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, contractAddress);
contract.events.Transfer({
  fromBlock: 'latest',
}, (error, event) => {
  if (event.returnValues.amount >= BIG_BUY_THRESHOLD) {
    sendBigBuyAlert(event.returnValues);
  }
});

const sendBigBuyAlert = (eventData) => {
  console.log(`Big Buy Alert: ${eventData}`);
};

D. Liquidity Alerts Bot:

This bot monitors liquidity changes in the pools across different DEXs.

    Requirements:
        Track liquidity changes in each of the 4 pools.
        Alert when liquidity changes significantly.

    Implementation:
        Poll each DEX for liquidity data.
        Calculate the change in liquidity and trigger an alert when it exceeds a threshold.

const checkLiquidityChange = async () => {
  const liquidityBefore = await getLiquidity(); // Fetch current liquidity
  setTimeout(async () => {
    const liquidityAfter = await getLiquidity();
    if (Math.abs(liquidityAfter - liquidityBefore) > LIQUIDITY_THRESHOLD) {
      sendLiquidityAlert(liquidityAfter);
    }
  }, 10000); // Recheck after 10 seconds
};

const sendLiquidityAlert = (newLiquidity) => {
  // Send alert about liquidity change
};

5. Time & Cost Estimate:
Time Estimate:

    Backend Development (bots implementation and API interactions): 3–4 weeks
    Mobile App Development (React Native for user interface and alerts): 4–6 weeks
    Integration & Testing (bot and mobile app integration, error handling, testing): 2–3 weeks
    Total Estimated Time: 8–12 weeks

Cost Estimate:

    Backend Development: $4,000–$6,000
    Mobile App Development (React Native): $6,000–$8,000
    Integration & Testing: $2,000–$3,000

Total Project Cost: $12,000–$17,000

This estimate assumes a typical development rate of $50–$100 per hour, depending on your developer's location and expertise.
Conclusion:

It is absolutely feasible to build these bots on Ink, even without an indexer. However, the process will require creating custom solutions to interact with the blockchain and DEXs. Given the early stage of Ink and the ecosystem's reliance on aggregators like Superswap, this project could provide a huge opportunity, and building it now could give you a significant competitive edge in the market.
